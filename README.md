# 🛡️ AutoRail 
The word '*AutoRail*' is **auto**Gen and guard**rail** combined. 
Make LLM's output more consistent with human values, using [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) and [Guardrails](https://github.com/guardrails-ai/guardrails).

## 💡 What the project does
AutoRail is a proof of concept that utilizes AutoGen and Guardrails to align the output of LLMs with human values. It is a project that is still in progress. 
Our goal is to build a complete AI safety framework to evaluate and modify the output text of LLM so that its values align with those of *governments, political parties, and other organizations*.

## 🌟 Why the project is useful
This project provides a framework to score, evaluatr, and revise the output of LLM. 
We provide a framework and you provide the value documents of your organization.
